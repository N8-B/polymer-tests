# Polymer Tests
This is just some test components I made to begin learning Polymer.

## To Run Locally
Clone this repository and run server from the root of the project, or wherever the ´index.html´ file is located.

If you have Python (v2.7) installed, you can run a server from the root directory like so:

´python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000´

Open up a browser to ´localhost:3000´ to view the Polymer component imported in the ´index.html´ file.
